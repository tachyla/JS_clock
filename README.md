# JS_clock

This clock was built with pure Vanilla JavaScript.

I used used the transform property to rotate the div elements based on the current hour, minute, & second.  
The .getSeconds, .getMinutes, .getHours methods return the actual current time, which is pretty freaking cool.
Convert the time to an actual degree with a simple calculation and voila, a virtual clock!
